I want to create a website designed to help sutdents study for their exams.

The website will have a simple and clean design, and will be easy to use.

The website will use an open ai api to generate study materials based on the user's input.

The user will be able to input their course materials, and the website will generate a practice exam

The website will also have a chatgpt integration to answer questions and help the user study, aswell as provide a rescource area for the user to find notes and other study materials.

The website UI will be built using Sveltekit and TailwindCSS.

The website will function locally for the time being so no hosting is needed yet.

The website will utilize #A7DAD8, #8CA6DB, #B6CDBD and #F4D160 for its primary color scheme.

The website will utilize #C3B1E1, #E0E4E8 and #4A5568 for its secondary color scheme.

The website will have a modern and clean design.

The website will be responsive and will function on all devices.
